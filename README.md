**Design System**
_Color Scheme_
Our primary color scheme uses the color #e9e1d1. This color is used across various elements in the UI to maintain consistency with our branding.

_Fonts_
This project uses Inter as its primary font, automatically optimized and loaded via next/font. The font configuration is defined within the Tailwind CSS config file for easy customization and application.

_Font Sizes and Usage_
Font sizes are categorized as follows and can be adjusted in the Tailwind config file:

Normal (Body Text): Default size for paragraph text.
Heading (H1, H2, H3, etc.): Defined sizes for headings to maintain hierarchical and visual consistency.
Sub-heading: Used for sub-titles or secondary headings.

_Colors_
Defined within the Tailwind CSS config file, our color palette is designed to complement our primary color, ensuring accessibility and 
aesthetic appeal across the app.

_Tailwind CSS_
This project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. To customize fonts, font sizes, and colors, refer to the tailwind.config.js file. This approach enables quick and consistent application of the design system across the project.

Editing the Project
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
